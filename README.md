This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Description
Hygge (HOO-guh) is a Nordic word that describes a comforting, cozy feeling or
quality. In this case, Hygge is a React web app where users can record short entries
about what made them happy. Life is meant to be cruised
through and enjoyed, but too often people find themselves on autopilot, stuck in an
uncomfortable limbo. Hygge will act as a reminder that despite lifeâ€™s difficulties, positive
things await those who keep an eye out for them. Hygge is approachable to any
person who wants to invite more gratitude into their life and could be especially useful to
those struggling with anxiety and/or depression.
Developer Note: This is my very first React app, so I have a lot of improvements to make. Please
feel free to contact me regarding any advice or feedback. Thanks!
